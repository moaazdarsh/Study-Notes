    "text": "Using polar coordinates is simpler for circular motion, so the following are some important kinematic definitions in polar coordinates and periodic motion.\nAngular Displacement \\(\\bar\\theta = \\bar\\theta_f - \\bar\\theta_i\\), measured in \\(rad\\).\nAngular Velocity \\(\\bar\\omega = \\frac{d\\bar\\theta}{dt}\\), measured in \\(rad/s\\).\nAngular Acceleration \\(\\bar\\alpha = \\frac{d\\bar\\omega}{dt}\\), measured in \\(rad/s^2\\).\nFrequency \\(f = \\frac{no. \\: of \\: turns}{\\Delta t}\\)\nPeriodic time \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}= \\frac{1}f\\)\n\n\n\nFor a body attached to a spring which exerts a force \\(F = -kx\\) the equation of motion is: \\[\nm \\ddot{x} = -kx\n\\] once this differential equation is solved, the result will be able to describe the motion of the system.\n\\[\nx = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\\] Where \\(A\\) is the amplitude, \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}m}\\) is the natural frequency and \\(\\phi\\) is the phase at \\(t = 0\\).\n\n\n\nIf a spring system oscillates in a viscous fluid it will be affected by a damping force \\(F_d = -bv\\), and then its equation of motion is going to be as follows.\n\\[\nm \\ddot{x} = -kx - b \\dot{x}\n\\] There are three solutions to this deferential equation, we will only focus on two.\n\n\nWhere the damping is’t enough to prevent oscillation. \\[\nx = A_0 e^{-\\gamma t}\\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)\n\\] Where \\(\\gamma = \\frac{b}{2m}\\) and \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 + \\gamma^2}\\) is the damped frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that since the amplitude is decreasing exponentially the wave function is enveloped by the amplitude function \\(A = A_0 e^{-\\gamma t}\\).\nTo describe the decrease in the amplitude of oscillation we will construct a new definition.\nLogarithmic Decrement: \\(\\delta = \\ln(\\frac{A_n}{A_{n+1}}) = \\gamma T_d\\)\n\n\n\nIn this case the damping is just enough to prevent oscillation, so the body will return to the rest position as fast as possible without overshooting.\n\\[\nx = (d_1 + d_2 t)e^{-\\gamma t}\n\\]\nby differentiating we get:\n\\[\nv = d_2 e^{- \\gamma t} - (d_1 + d_2 t) \\cdot \\gamma e^{-\\gamma t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nA spring system that is affected by an external force \\(F = F_0 \\cos(\\Omega t)\\) and a damping force \\(F_D = -rv\\) will be described by the following equation of motion.\n\\[\nm\\ddot{x}  + k_s x + b\\dot{x} = F_0 \\cos(\\Omega t)\n\\]\nsolving this differential equation we get\n\\(x = A \\cos(\\Omega t - \\phi)\\), where \\(A(\\Omega) = \\frac{F_0}{m\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\Omega^2)^2 + (2\\gamma \\Omega)^2}}\\) and \\(\\phi = \\tan^{-1}( \\frac{2\\gamma \\Omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\Omega^2})\\).\nthe frequency of applied force that will result in the greatest amplitude is \\(\\Omega_A = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 -2\\gamma^2}\\) and that maximum amplitude is \\(A = \\frac{F_0}{r \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 -\\gamma^2}}\\).\nif we want the spring to oscillate at maximum velocity however, then \\(\\Omega = \\omega_0\\), the amplitude \\(A = \\frac{F_0}{r\\omega_0}\\), and \\(v_{max} = \\frac{F_0}b\\).\n\n\n\nWaves transfer energy from one place to another without the transmission of particles, they can be classified based on three criteria, firstly:\nMechanical Waves: need a medium to propagate.\nElectromagnetic Waves: don’t need a medium.\nsecondly:\nTransverse: the vibration is perpendicular to wave propagation.\nLongitudinal: the vibration is parallel to wave propagation.\nand lastly, Traveling and Standing Waves.\n\n\nThe function of a wave moving in a line is \\(y = f(kx-\\omega t)\\), from this we can find the differential equation for wave motion.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2}\n\\]\nA case of such wave equation is \\(y(x,t) = \\frac{A}{(x - vt)^2 + 1}\\), which describes a pulse moving through a medium such as a rope for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the equation that as time passes (as \\(t\\) increases) the curve will shift to the right, simulating the propagation of the wave, the velocity of a wave is determined by its medium so in the case of a rope the velocity \\(v = \\sqrt{ \\frac{T}{\\mu} }\\), where \\(T\\) is the tension in the wire and \\(\\mu\\) is the mass per unit length.\nHowever, we’re mainly concerned with sinusoidal waves which behave according to this equation.\n\\[\ny(x,t) = A \\cos(kx-\\omega t) = A \\cos(k(x-vt))\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}T\\) and \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the pulse, as \\(t\\) increases the wave propagates to the right.\n\n\n\nA continuous wave can be considered an infinite number of particles in simple harmonic motion, the energy of each particle \\(E = \\frac{1}2 k A^2\\), where \\(k = m \\omega^2 = m (2\\pi f)^2 = 4 \\pi^2 m f^2\\).\nReplacing \\(m = \\rho V = \\rho S l\\), where \\(S\\) is the cross-sectional area, and \\(l = vt\\).\n\\[\nE = 2 \\pi^2 \\rho S v t f^2 A^2\n\\] \\[\nP = 2 \\pi^2 \\rho S v f^2 A^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nthis section will discuss multiple topics regarding sound waves.\n\n\nGiven a source of spherical waves operating at a power output \\(P\\).\nIntensity: \\(I = \\frac{P}A = \\frac{P}{4 \\pi r^2}\\)\nSince sound waves are mechanical, longitudinal, and spherical waves; this equation applies to them; however, the human perception of sound is logarithmic.\nSound Intensity: \\(\\beta = 10 \\log(\\frac{I}{I_0})\\), where \\(I_0 = 10^{-12}\\) and \\(\\beta\\) is measured in decibel \\((dB)\\).\n\n\n\nWhen two waves with slightly different frequencies interfere, the difference between their phases continuously changes making them shift back and forth between constructive and destructive interference, so they produce a wave with periodically variable amplitude called a Beat.\nmathematically this can be represented by adding the two waves \\(D_1 (x,t) = A \\cos(\\omega_1 t - kx)\\) and \\(D_2 (x,t) = A \\cos(\\omega_2 t - kx)\\).\nresulting in the following equation for beats:\n\\[\nD (x,t) = 2A \\cos(\\frac{|\\omega_1 - \\omega_2|}2 t - kx) \\cos(\\frac{|\\omega_1 + \\omega_2|}2 t - kx)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe frequency of the new sound is \\(\\frac{f_1 + f_2}2\\), but the frequency of the beat is \\(\\frac{f_1 - f_2}2\\).\n\n\n\nIf either the source of sound or the receiver is moving towards or away from the other then the perceived frequency is different, in the case of a moving receiver, it’s because the relative velocity between him and the wave is changed, in the case of a moving source, it’s because the motion changes the produced wave frequency.\n\\[\nf' = f_0 \\cdot  \\frac{v_0 \\pm  v_r}{v_0 \\mp v_s}\n\\]\nWhere \\(v_0\\) is the wave speed (sound speed is around 343 m/s).\nNote: \\(v_r\\) is +ve when the receiver is approaching while \\(v_s\\) is -ve when the source is approaching and vise versa.\n\n\n\n\nCoherence is a measure of how constant the phase difference between to waves is, The addition of two coherent waves of phase differences \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) is called interference, it can be constructive if \\(\\Delta \\phi = m \\cdot 2\\pi\\), or destructive if \\(\\Delta \\phi = (2m + 1)\\pi\\).\nFor two coherent waves which have taken different paths \\(\\Delta \\phi = k \\Delta r\\) is the phase difference between the two waves.\n\n\n\nIf a pulse travels from a light segment of the rope to a denser one it experiences a \\(\\pi \\; rads\\) change in its phase which happens to prevent the rope from snapping apart.\nSo when sending a sinusoidal wave through the rope with both ends fixed, two opposing waves \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) will be generated with a phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi = \\pi\\), the interference of the two waves forms a standing wave which can be described as follows. \\[\ny_1 + y_2 = A \\cos(kx-\\omega t) + A \\cos(kx + \\omega t + \\pi)\n\\] \\[\n= -2A \\sin(kx) \\sin(\\omega t)\n\\]\nA standing wave doesn’t propagate it only oscillates in place, and it assigns the amplitude of oscillation at any point on the rope by the function \\(2A \\sin(kx)\\), defining nodes as the points with no oscillation, and anti-nodes as the points with maximum oscillation. \\[\n2A\\sin(kx) = 0 \\rightarrow  kx = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda x = m\\pi\n\\]\n\\(\\therefore x = m\\frac{\\lambda}2\\) is the \\((m+1)th\\) node, where m starts from zero.\n\\[\n2A\\sin(kx) = 2A \\rightarrow  kx = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda x = (m + \\frac{1}2)\\pi\n\\]\n\\(\\therefore x = (m + \\frac{1}2) \\frac{\\lambda}2\\) is the \\((m+1)th\\) anti-node.\n\n\nA standing wave between two fixed ends must have a node at both ends, so the first end must be at \\(x = 0\\), the harmonic of the standing wave depends on the position of the second end.\nThe Fundamental Harmonic occurs when the second end is at the second node and separated by \\(L = \\frac{\\lambda}2\\) from the first end, which means there is only one loop, two nodes, and one anti-node.\nThe \\(\\textbf{nth}\\) Harmonic occurs when the second end is at the \\((n+1)th\\) node and separated by \\(L = \\frac{n \\lambda}2\\) from the first node, which means there are \\(n\\) loops, \\((n+1)\\) nodes, and \\(n\\) anti-nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA light ray traveling through a medium of refractive index \\(n_1\\) falls perpendicularly on a thin film of thickness \\(t\\) and refractive index \\(n_2\\) which’s placed between two mediums of refractive indexes \\(n_1\\) & \\(n_3\\), the ray reflected off the thin film and the ray reflected off medium \\(3\\) will interfere such that \\(\\Delta \\phi = k \\cdot 2t = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t\\).\nIf \\(n_2 &gt; n_1\\) XOR \\(n_3 &gt; n_2\\), The two rays will also have an additional phase difference of \\(\\pi\\), so \\(\\Delta \\phi = k \\cdot 2t + \\pi= \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t +\\pi\\).\nFor example, if \\(n_2 &gt; n_1, n_3\\) then to achieve destructive interference, we find the thickness of the film such that \\(\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t +\\pi = (2m + 1)\\pi\\).\n\\(t = m \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}2\\), for minimum thickness \\(m = 1\\).\nHowever if \\(n_3 &gt; n_2 &gt; n_1\\) in the case of coating then the phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t = (2m + 1)\\pi\\) in the case of destructive interference.\n\\(t = (2m + 1) \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}4\\), for minimum thickness \\(m = 0\\).\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the thin film, light rays coming from a medium of refractive index \\(n_1\\) fall perpendicularly on an optical wedge of angle \\(\\theta\\) and refractive index \\(n_2\\) surrounded by two mediums of refractive indexes \\(n_1\\) & \\(n_3\\), the two reflected waves will interfere following the same rule as the thin film \\(\\Delta \\phi = k \\cdot 2t = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t\\), forming an interference pattern which depends on the thickness of the wedge at any given point.\nUsually \\(n_2 &lt; n_1, n_3\\), to find the horizontal position of the dark fringes set \\(\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}\\lambda \\cdot 2t +\\pi = (2m + 1)\\pi\\) then substitute \\(x = t\\cot(\\theta)\\).\n\\[\nx_{dark} = \\frac{m \\lambda_{wedge}}2 \\cot(\\theta) = \\frac{m \\lambda_0}{2 n_{wedge}} \\cot(\\theta)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of modelling light as a stream of particles, Huygens’ Principle states that every wavefront contains an infinite number of spherical wavelet sources which in turn interfere to form the following wavefront.\nWhen light goes through a slit of width \\(a \\approx \\lambda\\) to fall on a screen at a distance \\(L &gt;&gt; a\\), an interference pattern is observed.\nUsing Huygens’ principle, we find that all of the wavelet sources interfere to produce the pattern, the distance between each two consecutive sources being \\(\\Delta y = \\frac{a}n\\), and the phase difference \\(\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\Delta y \\sin(\\theta) =  \\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda n} \\sin(\\theta)\\), the resultant of all the wavelets would be:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\delta) + A \\cos(\\omega t + 2 \\delta) + A \\cos(\\omega t + 3 \\delta) + ...\n\\]\nThe amplitude of the resultant \\(A_R = A \\frac{\\sin(n\\delta/2)}{\\sin(\\delta/2)} \\approx A \\frac{\\sin(n\\delta/2)}{\\delta/2}\\), this can rewritten in terms of the phase difference between the first and last wavelets \\(\\beta = n\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\sin(\\theta)\\).\n\\[\nA_R = nA \\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2} = A_0 \\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2}\n\\]\nSince the Intensity \\(I \\propto A^2\\). \\[\nI = I_0 \\frac{\\sin^2(\\beta/2)}{(\\beta/2)^2}\n\\]\n \n\\[\nM \\phi z \\alpha\n\\]"
